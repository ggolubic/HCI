Legendary action hero Sylvester Stallone teams up with successful action producer/director Michael Bay for the dystopian thriller Little America.

Sylvester Stallone and Michael Bay are teaming up for the dystopian thriller Little America. Despite being 73 years old, Stallone continues to reign as one of Hollywood’s biggest action heroes, with last year’s Rambo: Last Blood supposedly wrapping up the saga of his iconic character John Rambo to the tune of $91 million at the worldwide box office (against a reported budget of around $50 million).

Rambo may indeed at last be in his rearview mirror (at least until the next Rambo movie is announced) but Stallone is not slowing down his pace when it comes to action films. Next up for the star is 2020’s Samaritan, which sees Stallone playing a superhero who is presumed dead until a young boy goes looking for him. And of course there continue to be reports that Stallone will revive his popular all-star action franchise The Expendables, which last rode to theaters with 2014’s The Expendables 3.

As reported by Deadline, Stallone is also ready to suit up for the film Little America from executive producer Bay and AGC Studios, the company behind last year’s WWII epic Midway. Written by Rowan Athale, the new film is described as a dystopian thriller set in a world where America has become a war zone and many Americans have fled to a walled city within Hong Kong (no doubt inspired by the now-destroyed Kowloon Walled City). Stallone would play a former Army Ranger who is hired by a billionaire to find his missing daughter, with the sister of the missing girl joining him on the mission (and bringing her own skills to bear).

Little America marks the first collaboration of any kind between Stallone, one of the biggest action heroes of all-time, and Bay, one of Hollywood’s most successful action directors (though in this case Bay is serving as EP and not director). Bay of course spent a decade heading up the Transformers franchise, but recently returned to more old-school action with the Netflix film 6 Underground, which delivered on its promise of maximum Bayhem.

Dystopian sci-fi like Little America is of course a genre that Stallone happens to know well from his work on the well-remembered action film Demolition Man as well as the notorious flop Judge Dredd. With its story set inside a walled city, Little America naturally is drawing comparisons to John Carpenter’s cult classic Escape From New York, which saw Kurt Russell as a mercenary being hired to rescue the president from a maximum security prison implausibly taking up the entire island of Manhattan. Little America will give Stallone a chance to give his own interpretation of the Snake Plissken-type renegade character, and add to his incredibly lengthy – and amazingly still growing - resume of action hero roles. It will be interesting to see what the Stallone/Bay teaming cooks up if the film hits screens.
