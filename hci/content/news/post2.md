A Ubisoft Massive producer has confirmed that work for the previously announced Avatar game is still ongoing at the studio, with no word on release.

After first announcing the game back in 2017, a producer at Ubisoft Massive has confirmed that an Avatar game from the developers of the The Division franchise is still in the works at the studio. Gamers have been wondering just what the hold up has been for any news on the project. In truth, Ubisoft has been radio silent on the matter which led many to believe that it may have been shelved in favor of pursuing other priorities. Case in point, Tom Clancy's The Divison 2 has continued to be tweaked and expanded by Massive.

Most recently the team revealed Warlords of New York, a massive expansion for The Division 2 that will return players to the setting of the first game. These sorts of undertakings are massive feats of development for the aptly named Ubisoft Massive, so seeing an Avatar title pushed aside seems plausible. Add in the fact that Disney has since acquired the rights to Avatar during its acquisition of 21st Century Fox and the entire situation becomes much murkier. Despite all of this, it sounds like the game is moving forward.
