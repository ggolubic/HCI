I've always wanted to sit down and write down my whole journey of how I transitioned into tech and landed a web developer role without a college degree or bootcamp experience. I strictly used free or low cost online resources.

My particular journey contains so many mistakes and failures along the way that I ultimately feel like was essential to my growth.

## My Background

Without diving too deep into my background, I am 23 years old and was born and raised in Southern California. I'm the first in my family to graduate high school. I dropped out of college my freshman year and ended up without direction or a sense of purpose. I started working as a cashier at places like Macys and Kohls. I felt like an embarrassment, not because I was working retail but because people around me had set expectations for me to be an overachieving college student. I didn't have a passion for years.
