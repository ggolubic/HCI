Filming on Shazam 2 reportedly begins this summer, around the same time Dwayne Johnson's Black Adam DCEU solo movie goes into production.

Filming on Shazam 2 is reportedly set to begin this summer, around the same time Dwayne Johnson's Black Adam DCEU movie goes into production. Released in April 2019, the original Shazam introduced Asher Angel as 14-year old street-smart foster kid Billy Batson and Zachary Levi as the film's namesake, the superhero Billy turns into by calling out his name. Praised by critics for its self-aware humor and deeper themes about found families and emotional trauma, Shazam went on to become a proper box office success and now has a sequel in the pipeline for release in April 2022.

For years, the (reported) plan was for Johnson's Black Adam to appear in the first Shazam movie. However, in no small part thanks to The Rock's sky-rocketing popularity over the last decade, things changed and the character has since been granted a film of his own, which will open in December 2021. It's speculated the Black Adam movie will evolve the longtime DC Comics villain into more of an antihero before he and Shazam finally cross paths in the DCEU, potentially in Shazam 3 (should it happen). In fact, audiences might even get a small taste of that in the next couple years.

According to GWW, Shazam 2 is currently gearing up to start filming in July, which is the same month Black Adam begins shooting (as Johnson announced last fall). Given the movies are releasing less than three and a half months apart, there's bound to be some overlap in their production timelines, even if Shazam 2 rolls camera a little later than tentatively projected.

Considering they're releasing back to back in the DCEU slate, it only makes sense for Black Adam and Shazam 2 to cross-over in some fashion and tease the inevitable showdown between their namesakes. Of course, that would be all the easier to do with the two films shooting at the same time. Obviously, though, this wouldn't mean Black Adam is the secret baddie in Shazam 2; previously, Levi said it's unlikely his and Johnson's superheroes will meet up properly until Shazam 3 and possibly even after Black Adam 2 (again, if it happens). Even so, there's nothing to prevent Shazam from being referenced in Black Adams' post-credits scene, or vice versa with Shazam 2.

With Shazam director David F. Sandberg and writer Henry Gayden back for the sequel, the odds are in favor of Shazam 2 turning out well enough for Warner Bros. to want to keep the franchise not only going, but growing by bringing Black Adam into the fold. The latter's movie is similarly expected to be a commercial success, if only thanks to Johnson's draw at the box office. And while the DCEU has really found its footing post-Justice League by moving away from the MCU shared universe model, this is one case where a crossover not only makes sense, it should benefit both sub-franchises from a storytelling perspective. Whether that will happen in Shazam 2 and/or Black Adam remains to be seen.
