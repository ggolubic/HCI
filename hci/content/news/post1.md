The Visual Effects Society issues a statement criticizing the Oscars for a joke that blamed the failure of Cats on poor CGI work.

Visual effects artists criticize the 2020 Oscars for a joke that blamed the failure of Cats on poor CGI. Released this past holiday season, director Tom Hooper's adaptation of the famous musical became a rather infamous bomb to close out 2019. Widely panned by critics, Cats flopped at the box office and was on pace to lose a whopping \$71 million. Things were so bad, Universal opted to pull award considerations for the film, focusing their efforts instead on better-received films like 1917.

While the studio didn't campaign for Cats to receive Oscar nominations, the film still had a presence at the 92nd Academy Awards. Presenters James Corden and Rebel Wilson, both of whom starred in Cats, appeared onstage dressed in costumes as they handed out the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. The bit included a joke where the two said that since they were in Cats, they understood "the importance of good visual effects." Cats, of course, was mocked for the "digital fur technology" used to make its actors look like CGI animals. Not everyone found this wisecrack funny, including the Visual Effects Society.
