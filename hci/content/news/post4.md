Just built my new personal website using GatsbyJS.

Very cool framework that allows a backend services engineer like myself to easily use all the slick, new, front-end tech(react, graphql, webpack, etc) out of the box.

Definitely recommend checking it out if you need to crank out a static website(https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).
