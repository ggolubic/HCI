During an Instagram Live, Lady Sif actress Jaimie Alexander seemed to hint she's returning to the MCU, but will she be in Loki or Thor 4?

Lady Sif actress Jaimie Alexander hints she might be returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but will she be in the Disney+ series Loki or Thor: Love and Thunder? Alexander made her last MCU appearance in a 2015 episode of Agents of SHIELD, while her last film appearance was in Thor: The Dark World in 2013. While she is one of Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) closest friends, Sif was left out of Thor: Ragnarok with no mention of where she was. That left fans wondering where Sif was, and if she would ever return.

The MCU is entering a new era following the conclusion of its epic Infinity Saga. Beginning with Black Widow in May, Phase Four will include Disney+ shows in addition to films. Loki, starring Tom Hiddleston as the beloved trickster god, will be the third series to hit the streamer. Fans got their first glimpse of Loki back in action last week during a TV spot that aired during the Super Bowl. Meanwhile, recent Oscar winner Taika Waititi will return to direct Love and Thunder, which will hit theaters in November 2021 and bring back Hemsworth, Tessa Thompson, and Natalie Portman.

Alexander's comment about possibly needing to ride a horse with a sword again suggests she could be preparing for the action sequences of Love and Thunder. However, the fact that she cannot talk specifically about what she's working on at the moment could reference Loki, which is currently in production. Marvel is notorious for keeping secrets and preventing their actors from sharing even the tiniest details about their projects, explaining why Alexander joked she might disappear if she told the truth. If Alexander joined Loki, she would be the first returning MCU character aside from Loki himself to join the show.

Of course, Alexander could end up in both projects. Early reports suggested Loki could somehow tie into Love and Thunder, and if Alexander appeared in both, she could help bridge the gap. Seeing Sif again in any part of the MCU would be a nice touch, especially since the rest of Thor's friends were killed in Ragnarok. And since Portman is returning to the MCU for the first time since The Dark World, Love and Thunder could turn into quite the reunion. Fingers crossed!
