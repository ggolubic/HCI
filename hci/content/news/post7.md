Taika Waititi says he would be open to directing a Star Wars movie, as long as the project made sense for him and wouldn't be career suicide.

Taikia Waititi says he would be open to directing a Star Wars movie, as long as it wouldn't be career suicide. Back in January, reports indicated the Jojo Rabbit director had been approached by Lucasfilm to develop a new Star Wars film. At the time, Waititi had already earned much praise for his episode of The Mandalorian, which combined his trademark sensibilities of heart, humor, and action into a compelling package that brought the first season of the hit Disney+ series to a close. One of the biggest takeaways of the episode was that Waititi would be an excellent choice to helm a Star Wars movie.

That could very well happen one day, but it doesn't appear to be in the cards in the immediate future. Waititi recently denied reports that he was in line to call the shots on one of the upcoming Star Wars movies, dismissing the rumors in his own hilarious way. While he isn't going back to the galaxy far, far away any time soon, he would definitely be interested in the opportunity if the right project came along.

Speaking with Variety, Waititi once again debunked the notion that any serious conversations have taken place, but it sounds like he has a future in Star Wars if he wants one:
"I think people see me hanging out with people, especially with “Star Wars,” and think I’m having some big discussions about it. I would f—ing love to... If it was right. I would want to do any kind of movie if it made sense, and if it felt not like career suicide."

Previously, Waititi's discussed why he and Star Wars wouldn't be a good match, so this represents something of a change of tune for the filmmaker. Perhaps his experience on The Mandalorian gave him a fresh perspective, illustrating that it is possible for a unique auteur like himself to come in and tell a good Star Wars story. Rather than joking he'd be fired within a week of production starting (as he did when Phil Lord & Chris Miller and Colin Trevorrow had their problems with Lucasfilm), Waititi is now game for it - so long as it makes sense. And, of course, it's worth pointing out that the same goes for any type of film, not just Star Wars movies. Waititi wouldn't have decided to direct Next Goal Wins if he didn't feel he was the right fit for that particular project. He's (smartly) not completely closing to door on more work with Lucasfilm in this response.

It'll probably be a while before anything more concrete comes into fruition on this front. Once he's done with Next Goal Wins, Waititi will be jumping back into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Thor: Love and Thunder, which is scheduled for November 2021. That means Waititi won't be free for another couple of years, and there's no telling what he'll be looking to tackle by then. The live-action Akira adaptation is still on the table (Thor 4 pushed that one to the back-burner), and there could be something else that pops up between now and then. It would be great if Waititi was able to direct a new Star Wars movie, but most everyone can agree it's better if he just keeps making films that fit his style - regardless of what they are.
