The Stranger is Netflix's juicy new British miniseries, based on the novel by Harlan Coben. We share exciting clues and layers most fans missed.
â €
From the very first episode of Netflix's The Stranger, based on the 2015 Harlan Coben novel of the same name, secrets and lies threaten to shatter an idyllic suburban UK community. As the series progresses, longtime friends and neighbors of Adam Price (Richard Armitage) are revealed to be capable of unspeakable deception, and the greatest secret of all hovers over the Price family like a black cloud.

From fake pregnancies, to covert love affairs, hidden corpses, and revenge porn, The Stranger exposes the dirt on everyone, blackmailing them into submission. As Adam races to discover her true motive and the reason behind his wife's disappearance, clues lead to more questions than answers. Here are 10 hidden details in The Stranger everyone completely missed.

When The Stranger approaches Adam with the heartbreaking news that his wife faked her third pregnancy, he doesn't believe her. The seed of doubt is planted, however, and he dashes home to review the sonograms of his children. After comparing the three, he immediately searches for "Novelty Funsy" online.

What detail tipped him off? His sons' sonograms had the name of the hospital printed at the top (the same hospital where Dante was treated), and the third (the generic fake purchased from Novelty Funsy) dated 2017 did not. They also specializes in fake injuries and fake pregnancy tests.

#### 3/3 THE COBENS HAVE CAMEOS

Harlan Coben, the New York Times best-selling author of page-turning thrillers, wrote The Stranger in 2015, one of seven novels in a similar theme. Viewers curious to know what he looks like need only watch the detective at the computer in "Episode 2" of the Netflix series.

Good writing apparently runs in the family, and if viewers are paying attention to the credits in "Episode 5," they might just catch the name "Charlotte Coben" flash across their screens. That's Harlan Coben's daughter, who wrote the arc in that episode.

#### 2/3 WHAT'S IN A NAME?

While The Stranger may be turning random individual's lives upside down, most of them have reasons for her interference. If viewers are paying attention to Martin (Stephen Rea) in "Episode 6," they might be listening for him to reveal the gender of the child he had with his dead wife.

His murder confession simply refers to his child being named "Chris," but the innocent name drop ends up becoming a major clue in the final episode. Even though Adam grew up living next to Martin and his family, he never knew that Martin had a young child.

#### 1/3 THE BRITISH INVASION

The Stranger novel originally takes place in the United States, predominantly in the suburbs of Ohio, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The Netflix series is set in England, forcing changes to everything from suburban culture to the details of the police investigation.

The original novel had a lot more firearms, but because of the UK's very strict gun laws, they only appear at very key moments in the series. Adam's sons tried out for football (soccer) instead of lacrosse (as in the novel), and every tense conversation was had over a cup of tea and a scone.
