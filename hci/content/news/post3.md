The Honest Trailers for Terminator: Dark Fate highlights the various similarities between the box office bomb and other movies.

The Terminator: Dark Fate Honest Trailer highlights how unoriginal the sequel was. After 2015's Terminator: Genisys failed to launch a new trilogy, the franchise returned this past fall with another new installment. The difference this time around was that Dark Fate served as a direct sequel to Terminator 2: Judgment Day, featuring the anticipated return of Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor. Coupled with the fact Terminator creator James Cameron coming back as producer, there was much hope that Dark Fate could be a return to form for the property.

And in some respects, it was. Dark Fate received generally positive reviews from critics, but that word-of-mouth didn't do much to help the film's commercial prospects. Dark Fate bombed at the box office and was on pace to go down as a $120 million loss. It only grossed $261.1 million worldwide against an \$185 million budget, becoming yet another non-starter for the Terminator franchise. Many viewers have already moved on from it, but the book can't be closed until Honest Trailers has their say. And now, that video is online.
